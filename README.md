# OnlinePasswordCracker
This Script was created for Educational purposes only. It is made to crack the username and passwords of a website created for these educational purposes only.

This is done by sending a HTTP request to the backend using curl which mimics a login attempt. Based on the response from the server, we know whether the username and passwords are valid or invalid.
